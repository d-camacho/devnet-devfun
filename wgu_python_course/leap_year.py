5.16 LAB: Leap year
A year in the modern Gregorian Calendar consists of 365 days. In reality, the earth takes longer to rotate around the sun. To account for the difference in time, every 4 years, a leap year takes place. A leap year is when a year has 366 days: An extra day, February 29th. The requirements for a given year to be a leap year are:

1) The year must be divisible by 4

2) If the year is a century year (1700, 1800, etc.), the year must be evenly divisible by 400; therefore, both 1700 and 1800 are not leap years

Some example leap years are 1600, 1712, and 2016.

Write a program that takes in a year and determines whether that year is a leap year.

Ex: If the input is:

1712
the output is:

1712 - leap year

# receive input
input_year = int(input())

# leap years must meet two criterias -- the year number must be divisible by four â€“ except for end-of-century years, which must be divisible by 400 
# determine if leap year if century year
if input_year % 100 == 0 and input_year % 400 == 0:
    print(f'{input_year} - leap year')
# determine if leap year if not century year
elif input_year % 100 != 0 and input_year % 4 == 0:
    print(f'{input_year} - leap year')
else:
    print(f'{input_year} - not a leap year')
